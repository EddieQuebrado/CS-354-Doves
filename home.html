      <h1>Python Introduction </h1>
      <h2>General Summary </h2>
      <h4> History of Python </h4>
	  <p>Python was made by Guido can Rossum in 1989 at CWI! No, not that CWI. Cebtrum Wiskunde and Informatica, in Amserdam. Guido built the language, inspired by languages like Java, Lisp, Perl, Haskell and C, to try to create something just as powerful and useable, while also making it as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as possible. Bringing powerful languages down to a level where a less skilled programmer can still weild all the power a language like C++ or Java can have, without all the annoying intricacies or weird formatting to hinder them.</p>
	  <p>The language is known for being a bit of a one-size-fits-all language, useable in a lot of different programming situations. Scripting, programming, machine learning, graphics processing, and all kinds of other things. However, instead of making the language with all this functionality out-of-the-box, Guido decided to instead focus on making Python an incredibly extensible language. Combined with it's focus on ease of use, as well as readaiblity, it makes Python one of the most popular and most versitile language in the world.</p>
	  <p>According to 'Zen of Python', written by Tim Peters, Python has many key guiding principles:</p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
		  <li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
		  <li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
		  <li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
		  <li>Flat is better than nested.</li>
		  <li>Sparse is better than dense.</li>
		  <li><b>Readability counts.</b></li>
		  <li>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</li>
		  <li>Although practicality beats purity.</li>
		  <li>Errors should never pass silently.</li>
		  <li>Unless explicitly silenced.</li>
		  <li>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</li>
		  <li>There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.</li>
		  <li>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</li>
		  <li>Now is better than never.</li>
		  <li>Although never is often better than right now.</li>
		  <li>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</li>
		  <li>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</li>
		  <li>Namespaces are one honking great idea—let's do more of those!</li>
		  <li>Use proper indentation or I'll break your kneecaps.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>(...Ok, maybe not that last one.)</p>
	  <p>So, while it's not the most technically powerful language in the world, it's extensibility combined with it's user-friendly nature makes it one of the most effective languages in the world.</p>

      <h4>Where Python is used today</h4>
	  <p>Have you ever used Wikipedia? How about Google? Facebook? Spotify? Reddit? Well, congradulations, all of those sites use python in their websites. In fact, Reddit is implemented in Python entirely! It's versatility makes it a natural choice for most websites.</p>
	  <p>Python is included in standard operating system MacOS, as well as almost every distribution of Linux.</p>
	  <p>Python is even used by NASA! Meeting the United Space Alliance's requirements of a language being 'fast, cheap and light', Python is used by NASA today to do secret-NASA things. They don't tell anyone <i>exactly</i> what they're doing with it, but they're NASA, so that makes sense.</p>
	  <p>The Raspberry Pi (a computer about the size of a wallet, costing less than $40) has the word 'Pi' in it's name not only as a clever play on words, but as a reference to Python! Python is a primary language used on the Pi, and a majority of the systems on it are built and optimized for Python programs and programming.</p>
	  <p>Python has even gone on to inspire many other languages, such as Groovy, a language built to make Java more Python-like. Other inspired languages include Cobra, CoffeeScript, Go, Swift, and many others. Specifically, those languages usually follow in Python's footsteps in terms of syntax, indentation style, and ease-of-use.</p>
    <h4> Python's programming paradigms </h4>
    <p> Python supports four main programming paradigms: imperative, functional, procedural, and object oriented. This page will only be highlighting the object oriented and procedural paradigms.
	  <h3>Object oriented Python</h3>
	  <p>Python is used as an object-oriented language (OOL). Object-oriented programming is a unique and difficult concept, but to put it simply: it acts on the idea that everything in a given program is an 'object', with properties and functions that can be the same as other objects, but act independantly. It saves on resource useage, while also making the program much easier to manage. In an OOL, if you want there to be two different cars in your program, you just call two Cars(), and differentiate them. In a non-OOL, however, you have to create the codebase and the programming for each car independantly, which takes more time, disk space, and resource useage when running the program. This is a simple explanation, of course.</p>

	  <h3>Procedural Python</h3>
	  <p>Python is commonaly used as a procedural programming language in scripting environments. This paradigm is a subset fo imperative programming in which statements are structured into procedures. This paradigm is typically a list of instructions that execute one after the other starting from the top of the first line of the program. This is useful for creating modules that can be unrelated to other modules and programs yet still be accessed by said programs and work together with other modules to achieve goals for the program. As well as support resue of procedures within a program that are defined in either other libraries or modules.</p>

      <!-- <h4>Short explanation of how python is a object-oriented language (Maybe scripting language as well)</h4> -->
      <h4>Quirks and and advantages</h4>
	  <p>No language is perfect, but every language has it's specialties, and Python is no exception. What some would consider downsides, other consider features. Here's a few examples of how Python is a bit different than other, similar languages:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>It's extreme <b>Popularity</b> makes it a bit of a token choice at times, but also makes it compatible with countless codebases and modules people have made in the past</li>
		<li>It's fundamentally <b>Object-Oriented</b> nature makes it useable in modern object-oriented programming styles, and especially powerful when dealing with large amounts of objects or data.</li>
		<li>Python features <b>Automatic Garbage-Collection</b>, making it easy for people to toss large amounts of data around without having to worry about data leaks.</li>
		<li>It's <b>Ease-of-Use</b> as well as it's relatively <b>Forgiving Learning Curve</b> makes it ideal for beginning programmers, or those learning the language for a project.</li>
		<li>It's <b>Expansive Standard Library</b> makes it incredibly powerful even without any expansions, making it incredibly useful out-of-the-box.</li>
		<li>Python is an <b>Indentation/Whitespace Sensitive</b> language, meaning the indentation style is important and fundamental to how it's written. Many people don't like this, but it removes the need for many formatting items such as brackets ((){}[]) in certain scenarios.</li>

      <h2>Python Fundamentals</h2>
      <h4>How to start IDLE</h4>
		<p>IDLE is Python's own little development interface, which comes with the installation of Python. Basically, it's where you type the code to make the code work. While other IDEs are useable, we'll be sticking with this one for now. Instructions on how to install IDLE (and Python as a whole) are in the 'installation' section.</p>
		<p>After installing IDLE/Python, IDLE should be available as an application. Running that will open a menu that looks a little like this:</p>
		<code>Python 3.9.0 (tags/v3.9.0:9cf6752, Jan  1 2048, 42:00:69) [MSC v.1927 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32</code> <br>
		<code>Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.</code> <br>
		<code>>>></code> <br>
		<p>If you see this, don't panic, you're exactly in the right spot. This is called the 'Python Shell'</p>
		<p>Typing code into here will run it. For example, type this:</p>
		<code>asdf = 12</code>
		<p>Then press enter. After that, type</p>
		<code>print(asdf)</code>
		<p>And press enter. Underneath what you just typed, the number 12 should appear. While you may not know why yet, just know that IDLE is working properly.</p>
		<p>BUT: what if you want to make programs?</p>
		<p>To make a new program, head to 'file' and hit 'New File'. This will let you make your own Python programs which will run in the Python Shell.</p>
      <h4>What you need for a program to run.</h4>
		<p>Once you have a new file open to start making code, make some code!</p>
		<p>Let's start with something simple. Type the following:</p>
		<code>myCoolInteger = 8675309</code><br>
		<code>myCoolString = "cool"</code><br>
		<code></code><br>
		<code>print(myCoolInteger,"is",myCoolString)</code><br>
		<p>Once you have your program all typed up, hit 'File', then 'Save', and store it somewhere.</p>
		<p>To run your cool new program, hit 'Run', then 'Run Module'. The Python Shell will run your brand new code in it.</p>
      <h4>Syntax (needs expanded on but we need to consider what is to be documented here or in our examples)</h4>
		<p>Python's written syntax is relatively simple, with one key thing that many languages do not have: <b>significant indentation!</b></p>
		<p>While good indentation in other programs is recommended for readability, in Python it's also important for the compiler to read it too. Where you put your tabs and why is very important. For example, everything contained in a 'while' loop or an 'if' statement must be indented within it, or else it assumes it not to be part of that loop.</p>
		<code>x = 2</code><br>
		<code>if x==2:</code><br>
		<code style="margin-left: 40px">    print("I'm in the if!")</code><br>
		<code>print("I'm not in the if!")</code><br>
		<p>Or:</p>
		
		<code>while x &#60; 5:</code><br>
		<code style="margin-left: 40px">print("I will print 5 times!")</code><br>
		<code style="margin-left: 40px">x = x + 1</code><br>
		<code>print("I will print once!")</code><br>
		
		
		<p>Aside from that, Python syntax is pretty straight-forward. Creating a variable is done with [name] = [value], such as: </p>
		<code>HowOldAmI = 22</code>
		<p>And Python is built to understand what variable type it should be! In this instance, HowOldAmI would be an integer, with the data '22' stored inside it.</p>
		<p>Comments are easy too! Just use the # character to leave a comment, and the computer will ignore whatever you throw in there.</p>
		<code>while x &#60; 5: #I am the ghost of development past!</code><br>
      <h4> Common built in data structures</h4>
	  <p>There's a boatload of ways to store a pile of data. Unordered? Ordered? Changeable? It seems there's a data type to support whatever you need. We'll start with these four:</p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>Lists</li>
		  <li>Sets</li>
		  <li>Tuples</li>
		  <li>Dictionaries</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  	<table>
		  <tr>
			<th>Type:</th>
			<th>Ordered?</th>
			<th>Indexed?</th>
			<th>Changeable?</th>
			<th>Annoying?</th>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>List</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>No</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>Tuple</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>No</td>
			<td>Kinda</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>Set</td>
			<td>No</td>
			<td>No</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>No</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>Dictionary</td>
			<td>No</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>Yes...</td>
		  </tr>
		</table>

      <h4> Control flow statements</h4>
	  <p>When does the code learn what code to run next?</p>
	  <h5>IF</h5>
	  <p>Good ol' IF.</p>
	  <p>Syntax:</p>
	  <code>x = 2</code><br>
		<code>if x==2:</code><br>
		<code style="margin-left: 40px">    print("I'm in the if!")</code><br>
	  <p>IF is used to check a conditional statement to know whether or not to run a set of code. It checks to see if a particular thing is true or not, and if it is, it runs whatever is indented in front of it.</p>
	  <p>May contain an optional 'else' statement, which is a set of code to run instead if the conditional isn't true.</p>
	  <h5>FOR</h5>
	  <p>FOR is a bit more complex. FOR [things] IN [list]: [do stuff to things]</p>
	  <p>It runs over the same code over and over again for a list of items in an array.</p>
	  <p>Syntax:</p>
	  <code>for x in range(1,8):</code><br>
		<code style="margin-left: 40px">    print(x, "bottles of beer on the wall")</code><br>
	  <p>May contain an optional 'else' statement, which runs when the FOR loop finishes.</p>
	  <h5>WHILE</h5>
	  <p>The WHILE is like an IF if it got stuck, like a record player. It keeps doing that little bit of code, over and over again, as long as it's conditional is still true.</p>
	  <p>Syntax:</p>
	  <code>x = 2</code><br>
		<code>while x &#60; 8:</code><br>
		<code style="margin-left: 40px">    print("I'm in the while!")</code><br>
		<code style="margin-left: 40px">    x = x + 1</code><br>
	  <p>May contain an optional 'else' statement, which runs when the WHILE loop finishes.</p>
