        What you need for a program to run

        How to declare a variable
            Explanation of different variable types
                str?

            Brief explanation of scope, with promise to explain it more later
            Warning about how a variables type is set when you assign it a value, and the type cannot change.
            Explain declaring with casts vs just declaring
                int()
                float()
